Whether
it’s taking a ride in Uber or Lyft, adjusting the lights in
your home with your Alexa, or sharing that family video on
Facebook, we’re creating data at an accelerating rate every day. At DZone.com,
our Database Zone has been growing steadily, fueled by a
resurgence of interest in relational databases, the emergence
of SQL layers on other types of data stores, and the need to
manage your databases like you manage the other parts of
your infrastructure. Traditionally, changes to database technology have come
slowly compared to the other components of modern web
development. To be sure, the increase
in adoption of DevOps practices has also had a significant
impact on the pace at which databases and database
technology evolve.
