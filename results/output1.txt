The Chrysler Building, the famous art deco New York skyscraper, will be sold for a small fraction of its previous sales price. The deal, first reported by The Real Deal, was for $150 million, according to a source familiar with the deal. The building sold fairly quickly after being publicly placed on the market only two months ago. The incentive to sell the building at such a huge loss was due to the soaring rent the owners pay to Cooper Union, a New York college, for the land under the building.
